# Mostly raw and unedited copy of whiteboard notes

I was thinking about projects, etc. at the time.


## Random Thoughts

* portability
* hygiene

* urgent v. important

* [ ] PR to Viktor
* [ ] renew pinboard.in

* push model v. pull model
 * DESCRIBE - learn (blog) first or project first

* dialogues
 * agile -
 * continue? - if needed - maybe mock phone screen / in-person interviews?
  * questions, etc.
  * "innovation"

* [ ] laptop - old, new
 * migrate

* be employable / attractive
 * be the employer (dialogues)
  * e.g., hire for a role on team Meteor (Andrey Utis, George Parris, Srini Uppalapati, etc.)

* screencasts, educational videos
 * ...

* Dashlane
 * browser passwords, client passwords
  * not synced?


## Project Ideas

* 1 - password generator
 * multiple / epic++

* 2 - screencasts, educational videos
 * multiple / epic++

* lots of potential for overlap btw. 1 and 2 above

* NB: don't try to bind things together: tight coupling makes things:
 * brittle (explain please) (harder to refactor for instance)
 * more complicated
 * less reusable / general

* [ ] learn Screenflow
 * DO NOT BUY (maybe later)

* 30 in 30
 * what things? (below)
 * 10 minutes (max len) videos

* get my stuff up into GitHub (or GitLab for private repos)

* blogs

* AWS Certs
 * Architect Associate
 * Sysops Associate

* SSH Keys
 * durable, sustainable, automated rotation

* blog first -> screencast later (??)
 * later == after I understand the topic better

* HashiCorp tools! {{ <3 }}

* Elm lang
* Python

* Anki
 * Python
 * Git
 * AWS
 * Chef
 * Jenkins
