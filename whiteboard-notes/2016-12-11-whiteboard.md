## Random I

Password manager idea -- notebook

## Questions

"overall continuous delivery process" <- from req.

Q: "technical debt drastically reduced" <- examples?
Q: Who are this person's or team's customers?
Q: Is there an operations team or any sort of formalized release process?
   Trying to gauge how similar it is to what I've seen/done before.
Q: Learning environment?
   Colloquia or other ways of sharing achievements & research results (esp. interim results)?


## Strengths

1. Owner "unreasonable expectations"
2. Connector
3. Not a technology fetishist
   Love it, but am a partisan for the results the tech gives us, not the tech itself.
4. Think more broadly when appropriate
   Wide-angle v. zoom lens


## Random II

Go your own way - team or org level

### Costs

Sharing
Operations support // bias

### Benefits

Learn from others (new stack)
Empowering
Discovery

### Central admin

Restrictive
Wrong focus - reduces responsibility


## Strengths ABOVE

core to DevOps

1. Developers broaden their scope to include lifecycle management
2. Operators learn to write some code
3. Both work from something closer to a shared experience

(sounds so *idealistic* LOL)


## Random III

* **Believe strongly** in starting from first principles as a way of reducing bias
  EX: CD v. CD. Love it.

* Happy to ask the **DUMB QUESTIONS**. **STRONGLY PREFER** minor course corrections early on, rather than major resets later.

* **Believe strongly** in encouraging personal growth. The notion of a *"growth mindset"* may be somewhat discredited, but it's still a positive influence. I don't care to work with people who are satisfied with where they're at, and can't be motivated to challenge themselves.
  EX: Dehart and the new guy. Manager needs to provide some challenges/opportunities.

* Maybe disbanding OCD was the right move. I'm not impartial, but see why - we evolved to a sort of low-fitness dependency relationship with the sprint teams. I wanted us to provide tools and consulting expertise. But the line/boundary between advising and just do it for them was not strong (clear).

* Focus on one thing at a time. Make durable progress.
