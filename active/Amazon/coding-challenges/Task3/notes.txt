array A of N integers

given two indices I and J, such that
	0 <= I <= J <= N

exchange values at I and J

GOAL: check whether the array can be sorted into non-decreasing order by
performing at most one swap operation.


N is an integer within the range [1..100]

each element of array A is an element in the range [0..1 000 000 000]
