# README

First contact was from Lydia Backenstoe, around mid-December 2016.

We had a call in the days that followed, and things are okay so far.

Today (12/27), I had a second call, an informational interview with Arthur Lee
from the team that I'd (presumably) be joining.

I *really* enjoyed the call! The role that Arthur described sounds exactly like
what I want to do next. Here's a conversation between Julie and I, thru text,
after the call.


## Text Conversation

T: Just got off the phone with a guy from Amazon.
T: I have to say, it sounds like the best, most attractive role I've heard about so far.
T: It seems like a perfect fit with my current skills, and exactly what I'm
    looking for in terms of gaining new skills.
T: Scary :)

    [Aside: I'm still targeting a 10/30/2017 deadline to move into a consulting
    role.

    As an aside within an aside, I'm talking about the kind that Jan O'Brien
    describes as either helping a company change it's culture, or grow to the
    next level. I am not talking about her third kind, which is hiring a
    contractor to fill a role until they can find an FTE, possibly the
    contractor, who's effectively on "audition" for the role.

    In terms of growing into a consulting role, I've identified that I need
    some real world experience doing operations.]

J: That sounds awesome! Did he say what the next steps are?

T: I've written back to my contact [Lydia B.] over there, and let her know I'm
    interested in continuing the conversation. She'll arrange next steps.

J: Cool

T: It seriously sounds like a role they created for me. I've never had that
    experience before.
T: I'm gonna go find some lunch and a Linux administration book. :-)

J: LOL, really? Is it like work you've done already?

T: Sort of, but more like it's work that my career so far has prepared me to do.

J: :-)

T: :-)


## Resume


## Programming Tests

I thought I bombed it badly. Lydia came back and said I did great.

## Next Steps

Phone screen Tuesday 1/10 at 2pm with [    ] [    ] 

My goal as of right now (8 minutes before Nortek interview begins) is to have
an offer in hand days before, and use it as leverage.
