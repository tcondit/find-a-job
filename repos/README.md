# Repos

This directory holds Git repos I've contributed to. Maybe there's some good stuff here.

For example,

* DeploymentPipelinePOC has info about why we chose not to go with different CI/CD vendors. When chatting with PNNL, for example, they may want to hear about why we chose not to go with Bamboo.

* cofi-artifactory and cofi-jenkins both include Chef cookbooks and CloudFormation templates we've developed on my team.
