# Questions for All

TODO turn this into a LinkedIn essay

These are questions I may ask any future employer.

## Category A (TBD later)

1. Tell me about a really good day/experience.
1. Do you use Open Source software?
 1. Do you allow contributions back to Open Source projects?
1. What are some ways you give back to the communities where you operate?
1. What are some ways you ensure ongoing employee development?
1. Would you say there's a culture of "up or out" here?
 1. Alternatively, are you okay with people finding their niche and staying there? (For the record, I prefer "up or out", and would prefer to work with like-minded people.)



## Category B (TBD later)
